# lam with docker compose

This is a copy of my `lam-heroku` repo with docker-compose.

TO run this make sure you have go, docker-compose installed on local machine.


1. Get repo : `go get github.com/amku91/lam`

2. now `cmd` to lam directory and run `docker-compose build and docker-compose up`


That's All.
